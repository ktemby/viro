# AR Driving Car Demo

## Setup Instructions:
1. Open `App.js` and uncomment the line at the bottom `ViroCodeSamplesSceneNavigator = require('./js/ARDrivingCarDemo/ARDrivingCar');`
2. Open `ARDrivingCar.js` and add Viro API Key
3. Start `npm` packager server and run sample

## Notes:

- React Native w/ Android doesn't support multi-touch across multiple buttons, so you can only accelerate, decelerate or turn the steering wheel individually. (The experience works better on iOS)
