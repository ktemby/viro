/*
 Superclass for enabling spatial and temporal filtering of body pose data as
 received from an ML model. All data that passes the spatial filter is included
 in a 'tracking window' of recorded data, onto which temporal filtering is then
 applied.
 
 Filters can be stacked upon one another as well.
