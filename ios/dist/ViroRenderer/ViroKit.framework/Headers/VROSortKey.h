         We generally sort by rendering order and distance to camera, then by batch switching
         concerns (shader, textures, light, material), and finally by tie-breakers (node, 
         element index).
         
         For hierarchies, note that the distance from camera for all objects in a hierarchy
         is set to the distance from camera of the parent. This way distance from camera becomes
         irrelevant within a hierarchy, so that within each hierarchy we can sort by hierarchy
         depth only. Note we do not sort by hierarchy ID because it is ok to interleave objects
         of different hierarchies within the render order.
