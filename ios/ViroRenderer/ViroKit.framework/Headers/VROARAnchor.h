/*
 Anchors are real world objects detected by the AR engine. Each time an
 anchor is detected, the VROARSessionDelegate is given an opportunity to
 create a VRONode with virtual content to attach to that anchor. The
 ARSession will thereafter ensure that the virtual content is fused with
 the real-world anchor, thereby enabling applications to 'augment'
 reality with virtual content.
 
 For example, if a plane anchor is detected, the can use its corresponding 
 VRONode to place virtual objects for a table-top game.
 
 Anchors are regularly updated by the AR engine as the characteristics of 
 the anchor are further refined: for example, the AR engine may start with
 an approximation of a surface, and later determine the surface's width and
 height.
 
 VROARAnchor is subclassed by specific anchor types; planes, image targets, 
 etc.
